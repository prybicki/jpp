In second iteration I've implemented two more features:

1) Keywords "break" and "continue", working as in C, see example in file good/break-and-continue-proof.la

2) Arrays. Arrays can be any of primitive type: int, boolean, string.

Example: int[] intArray = [42, 1337] of int;
Out of bounds behaviour: will create such index with default value (behaves like a map of type int -> arrayType)
Negative indices are allowed.
Nested arrays are not allowed.
(Nested arrays were planned, but last-minute I realized the grammar is a bit wrong and
I'm not a fan of risky changes and hope non-nested are enough for arrays to be considered as implemented)

See example in file good/arrays-proof.la
